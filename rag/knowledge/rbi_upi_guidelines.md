RBI Guidance on Digital Payment and UPI Fraud Prevention
Overview
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) provides guidance to regulated entities on measures for preventing fraud in digital payments, including Unified Payments Interface (UPI). This focuses on consumer protection, temporary blocking mechanisms, and requirements for clear explanations to customers.

RBI Position on Digital Payment Fraud
RBI mandates regulated entities to implement robust systems for detecting and mitigating digital payment fraud. Entities must prioritize consumer protection by establishing protocols that safeguard customer funds and data. Guidance emphasizes timely identification of suspicious activities and coordinated response measures across payment systems.

Temporary Restrictions and Safeguards
Regulated entities may apply temporary restrictions, such as blocking access to payment instruments or accounts, upon detection of potential fraud. These measures serve as safeguards to prevent further unauthorized transactions. Restrictions must be proportionate, time-bound, and subject to review to balance fraud prevention with customer access.

Importance of Clear Customer Explanations
RBI requires entities to provide clear, transparent explanations to customers regarding any fraud-related actions taken. Communications must detail the reasons for restrictions, steps for resolution, and customer rights. Explainability ensures customers understand protective measures without ambiguity.
