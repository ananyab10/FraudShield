QR Phishing Fraud Patterns in UPI Systems
What QR Phishing Is (High Level)
QR phishing in UPI involves misuse of QR codes to initiate unauthorized payments. Attackers generate or alter codes to redirect funds from unsuspecting users scanning them during transactions.

Common Behavioral Signals
Patterns include rapid scanning of multiple unique QR codes from unfamiliar sources. Transactions often show atypical merchant details or mismatched payee information. High-velocity payments to newly added beneficiaries signal potential compromise.

Why QR-Based Transactions Require Caution
QR codes enable quick, one-tap payments, bypassing some verification prompts. This speed amplifies risks when codes link to fraudulent endpoints. Systems prioritize caution due to the irreversible nature of UPI transfers post-authentication.

System-Level Risk Interpretation
UPI platforms flag behaviors deviating from normal user patterns, such as unusual QR scan frequencies or geographic inconsistencies. Risk engines interpret these as phishing indicators to trigger safeguards, protecting the ecosystem from widespread abuse.
