NPCI UPI Operational Rules on Fraud Prevention
Overview of NPCI Role
The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) establishes operational rules for Unified Payments Interface (UPI) to maintain system integrity. These rules incorporate safeguards at the platform level to support secure digital transactions.

UPI Control Mechanisms
NPCI mandates controls including limits on beneficiary additions to prevent unauthorized linkages. QR payment processes include validation steps to verify transaction legitimacy. Authentication requires multi-factor mechanisms, such as device binding and biometric verification, for all UPI transactions.

Risk-Based Transaction Handling
Rules enable risk-based handling where transactions exhibiting anomalies trigger automated interventions. This includes velocity checks on frequency and amount, alongside real-time monitoring of payment patterns. QR-initiated payments undergo additional scrutiny based on risk indicators.

Rationale for Protective Blocks
Protective blocks activate under predefined risk thresholds to isolate potential issues. These measures preserve system stability by halting suspicious activities promptly. Blocks allow for verification and resumption once risks are resolved, ensuring continued UPI functionality.
